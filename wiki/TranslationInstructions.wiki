Use the Transfer Localizable.strings below to send the file to your iPhone/iTouch and test

Use the General Translation Information to help you understand how to translate the file


= General Translation Information =
*Basics:*

Download/save the "[http://mytime.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/English.lproj/Localizable.strings Localizable.strings]" file that has many lines in the form of:

{{{
/* Add a return visit action button */
"Add a return visit" = "Add a return visit";
}}}

The First line is called a "comment" it is just used to help you know where this text is used within the MyTime program.  Do not change this.

The Next line has two quoted sentences, do not change the first one, the first one is used by the program to lookup the translation.  The second quoted sentence is what you change.  You change this second quoted string to what is natural in your language.

I am trying to stay with the style of the iPhone, so if there are any buttons that it uses normally like "Edit" and "Done" in whatever other language is on your iPhone, please use those words.  Also pick words that show the meaning and do not take a lot of space. Just a warning, I am a picky person and capitalization, being formal with the text (no slang) and conveying the correct thought are very high priorities.  This program is to be used by many people, I would not like to offend anyone or stumble anyone because of this program.  I usually have a firm grasp on what is displayed on programs that I write, but unfortunately I can not translate the text into another language so I have to depend on and trust others to translate the text just like I would if I could.

*Variable wording:*

There are situations where you might need to reorder how things are displayed like the address:

In english house number and street name are represented like:
{{{
12318 Chicamauga Tr.
}}}

and in German it would look like:
{{{
Franz Marc St. 12318
}}}

The following is the block that you would have to modify for the address:
{{{
/* House number and Street represented by %1$@ as the house number and %2$@ as the street name */
"%@ %@" = "%1$@ %2$@";
}}}
As the comment sayd the %1$@ is the house number and the %2$@ is represented as the address. The above block is for English and the below text is in German.
{{{
/* House number and Street represented by %1$@ as the house number and %2$@ as the street name */
"%@ %@" = "%2$@ %1$@";
}}}
You will see that this is common throughout some of the translations. As you experiment with these you will see what needs to be put where (you will also see if you made a mistake)

*Singular/Plural:*

There are simple words that are included as translations purely for singular/plural versions of the words like "hours" or "hour", if you do not have a plural form of that word or it is natural to have the same word for 1 or more than one hour, minute, books, magazines, or whatever then you could just have the same translation for the plural and singular word. The Hour example is below:

{{{
/* Singular form of the word hour */
"hour" = "hour";

/* Plural form of the word hours */
"hours" = "hours";
}}}

*File format:*

When you can define the format that the file is saved in, make sure it is UTF8

Install "OpenSSH" using the Installer Application, and reboot your iPhone/iTouch (Hold down the power button and slide to power off and then turn it back on).

Connect your iPhone/iTouch to your home WiFi network (or a friend's WiFi network) and figure out what your IP address is, on the iPhone:
  # Click on Settings -> Wi-Fi
  # Select ">" on the WiFi network your iPhone is on
  # remember the X.X.X.X "IP Address" on that page

log into your iPhone:

Windows:
  # download [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe PSCP] and save it in your c:\Windows directory
  # open up a command line terminal Start->Run and type in "cmd" and hit OK
  # save the Localizable.strings file that I emailed you to a German.lproj directory or Romanian.lproj directory or <Insert Language Here>.lproj you need to create this directory somewhere and save the Localizable.strings file there
  # Navigate using the command line to the directory that holds the German.lproj, Romanian.lproj, Spanish.lproj, etc
  ## You can do this easily by typing *cd * (that is cd and then a space) and then drag your German.lproj directory into the command line, and then hit enter on the command line
  ## Now do a "cd .." on the command line, to move to the parent directory
  # Do Start->Run and type in "notepad.exe" to edit the Localizable.strings (yes you MUST use notepad to edit these files on windows)
  ## edit your Localizable.strings change the values and save 
  # Make sure that MyTime is "Quitted" on your iPhone/iTouch
  # Type in the following in the command line you still had open (replace X.X.X.X with the IP address that you got above, and use the right language German, Spanish, Portuguese, whatever the english version of your language is)  
{{{
pscp -r German.lproj root@X.X.X.X:/Applications/MyTime.app/
}}}
  # enter "alpine" as the password
  # after the file has been pushed, run MyTime and check your work (you have to have your language setup in Settings->General->International->Language)
  # you can go back to the "Edit your Localizable.strings file" step and repeat over and over


OSX:
  # open up a command line terminal "Applications/Utilities/Terminal"
  # Navigate using the command line to the directory that holds the German.lproj, Romanian.lproj, Spanish.lproj, etc
  ## You can do this easily by typing *cd * (that is cd and then a space) and then go to your German.lproj, Spanish.lproj or Italian.lproj directory and Command-C copy the German.lproj directory, and then go to the command line and use Command-V to paste the directory path, then hit enter
  ## Now do a "cd .." on the command line, to move to the parent directory
  # Do Start->Run and run "TextEdit" to edit the Localizable.strings (yes you MUST use textedit to edit these files on windows)
  ## edit your Localizable.strings change the values and save 
  # Make sure that MyTime is "Quitted" on your iPhone/iTouch
  # Type in the following in the command line you still had open (replace X.X.X.X with the IP address that you got above, and use the right language German, Spanish, Portuguese, whatever the english version of your language is)  
{{{
scp -r German.lproj root@X.X.X.X:/Applications/MyTime.app/
}}}
  # enter "alpine" as the password
  # after the file has been pushed, run MyTime and check your work (you have to have your language setup in Settings->General->International->Language)
  # you can go back to the "Edit your Localizable.strings file
