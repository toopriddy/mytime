#requests for help from a Graphics Artist, because I am not one.

I am a programmer, and have limited knowledge about graphic art programs.  I have done a "beta" job of producing images for the MyTime Program.  I received many pictures for the icon for MyTime and am very appreciative of the person that created it.

My concern is more along the lines about the buttons at the bottom of the MyTime view. (if you go to More->Edit you can see all of them, or just look at the picture below).  I do not want to add any snazzy/useless images or transitions, I want to make this program useful and minimize things that "just get in the way".

I am trying to stay with the "apple theme" of blue/gray buttons like what is used in the phone application on the iphone and the ipod application on the iphone. I want something that makes it obvious what the tab is that you are looking at.

The button bar pictures that are due for changing are:

  * *Date sorted:* I wish it were something like a calendar looking thing
  * *Street Sorted:* I tried to make it look like a street, but it looks bad
  * *Statistics:* it does not look like statistics but a book, and I dont know of a good way of representing this, maybe something like the "Field service activity report" that we have to fill out a mini version of that... i dont know
  * *City Sorted:* this is where my GIMP skills were put to the limit.  It seems to work, who knows maybe I am more critical of my own work than other people are.
  * *Mapped calls:* this looks like spaghetti but it is supposed to be the highways around Huntsville, AL
  * *Settings:* don't like this, I would like the gears or something like consistent with apple's gears for settings (I really don't want to put the settings in the settings application on the iphone)

I have other tabs that I want to come up with and it is always a choir to create the little icon for that tab.

What I might want to do is come up with an email list of people who could do some pictures for me and just email out for someone to offer help when available.
