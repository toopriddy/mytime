#Building MyTime

= Compiling MyTime =

I have built this in the following environmente:
  * Cygwin iphone dev environment
  * linux cross-tools environment
  * OSX cross-tools environment (10.4 and 10.5)

I am currently using 10.5 and Xcode to build/develop MyTime

== Linux and 10.4 setup ==
You are welcome to follow the instructions at  [http://code.google.com/p/iphone-dev/wiki/Building iphone-dev to build the tools].  The binary install package for OSX has different executable names and it seems like everyone used the iphone-dev instructions except for the people that built the binary package.

== 10.5 setup ==
I found a [http://kevinchiu.org/blog/archives/iphone-toolchain-for-leopard-version-030 page] that had a script you could run to build the toolchain for Leopard.

== cygwin setup == 
If I remember correctly you can [http://code.google.com/p/winchain/wiki/HowToUse follow the instructions here] to get the toolchain installed.

== Building ==
in the main directory just type make, or in Xcode build like normal
