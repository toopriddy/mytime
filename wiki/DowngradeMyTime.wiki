  # read the instructions above
  # Save off the old version of !MyTime in your iTunes library.  
    # Open your iTunes library and go to the "Mobile Applications" folder, this might be in a couple of locations:
      # *OSX:* ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications"
      # *XP:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications"
      # *Vista/Windows 7:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications"
    # copy "!MyTime <version number>.ipa" to your desktop (where <version number> is something like 2.9.0)
  # Now sync your iPhone with iTunes
  # Now if you are trying to get your old data from before !MyTime 3.1.0 to restore back to !MyTime-2.9.0 use the [http://code.google.com/p/!MyTime/wiki/iTunesBackup instructions here] to retrieve the "oldrecords.plist" and go ahead while you are at it and get the "!MyTime.sqlite" file
  # Now on your iPhone delete !MyTime *MAKE SURE YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE STEPS ABOVE*
  # Now on your computer in iTunes delete !MyTime
  # Sync your iPhone by right clicking your iPhone in iTunes and selecting "Sync"
  # Now drag that "!MyTime <version number>.ipa" file that we put on the desktop into iTunes (drag it to where the "LIBRARY" text appears and your cursor will get a plus sign on it)
  # !MyTime should now appear in your "Applications" entry in iTunes. You should right click !MyTime and select "Get Info" to verify that it is the previous version
  # in ITunes right click your iPhone and select "Sync"
  # verify that !MyTime is on your iPhone
  # If you are downgrading to !MyTime < 3.0 then
    # Find that "oldrecords.plist" file that we saved a couple of steps ago and rename the file to "oldrecords.!MyTimedata",
    # now create an email and attach this newly renamed file "oldrecords.!MyTimedata"
    # send this email to the account that is on your iPhone
    # on your iPhone open up your email and press on the "oldrecords.!MyTimedata" attachment, it will ask you if you want to open this file in !MyTime... press on "open in !MyTime"
    # !MyTime will ask you if you want to restore the file, press on "restore backup", and press "ok" on the prompt telling you to restart !MyTime
    # restart !MyTime, your data should be there and you should be running the old version of !MyTime
  # If you are downgrading to !MyTime  > 3.0 then
    # Find that "!MyTime.sqlite" file that we saved a couple of steps ago and rename the file to "!MyTime.!MyTimedb",
    # now create an email and attach this newly renamed file "oldrecords.!MyTimedb"
    # send this email to the account that is on your iPhone
    # on your iPhone open up your email and press on the "oldrecords.!MyTimedb" attachment, it will ask you if you want to open this file in !MyTime... press on "open in !MyTime"
