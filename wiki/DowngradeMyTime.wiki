= READ ME FIRST! =
You *_MUST_* make sure that all of the following critera are true before proceeding, you could loose all of your application data otherwise:
  * You have not synced your iPhone with iTunes since you updated !MyTime (if you have synced with iTunes already scroll down to the bottom of the page for some instrucitons)
  * Your iTunes library has the older version of !MyTime in it (go to the "Applications" entry in iTunes and right click !MyTime and select "Get Info" and verify the version number)


= Instructions =

  # read the instructions above
  # Save off the old version of !MyTime in your iTunes library.  
    # Open your iTunes library and go to the "Mobile Applications" folder, this might be in a couple of locations:
      # *OSX:* ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications
      # *XP:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications
      # *Vista/Windows 7:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications
    # copy "!MyTime <version number>.ipa" to your desktop (where <version number> is something like 2.9.0)
  # Now sync your iPhone with iTunes
  # Now if you are trying to get your old data from before !MyTime 3.1.0 to restore back to !MyTime-2.9.0 use the [iTunesBackup instructions here] to retrieve the "oldrecords.plist" and go ahead while you are at it and get the "!MyTime.sqlite" file
  # Now on your iPhone delete !MyTime *MAKE SURE YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE STEPS ABOVE*
  # Now on your computer in iTunes delete !MyTime
  # Sync your iPhone by right clicking your iPhone in iTunes and selecting "Sync"
  # Now drag that "!MyTime <version number>.ipa" file that we put on the desktop into iTunes (drag it to where the "LIBRARY" text appears and your cursor will get a plus sign on it)
  # !MyTime should now appear in your "Applications" entry in iTunes. You should right click !MyTime and select "Get Info" to verify that it is the previous version
  # in ITunes right click your iPhone and select "Sync"
  # verify that !MyTime is on your iPhone
  # if you are using Windows then you might have to show the file extensions to proceed, follow the instructions at [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/865219 here to show filename extensions]
  # If you are downgrading to !MyTime < 3.0 then
    # Find that "oldrecords.plist" file that we saved a couple of steps ago and rename the file to "oldrecords.!MyTimedata",
    # now create an email and attach this newly renamed file "oldrecords.!MyTimedata"
    # send this email to the account that is on your iPhone
    # on your iPhone open up your email and press on the "oldrecords.!MyTimedata" attachment, it will ask you if you want to open this file in !MyTime... press on "open in !MyTime"
    # !MyTime will ask you if you want to restore the file, press on "restore backup", and press "ok" on the prompt telling you to restart !MyTime
    # restart !MyTime, your data should be there and you should be running the old version of !MyTime
  # If you are downgrading to !MyTime  > 3.0 then
    # Find that "!MyTime.sqlite" file that we saved a couple of steps ago and rename the file to "!MyTime.!MyTimedb",
    # now create an email and attach this newly renamed file "oldrecords.!MyTimedb"
    # send this email to the account that is on your iPhone
    # on your iPhone open up your email and press on the "oldrecords.!MyTimedb" attachment, it will ask you if you want to open this file in !MyTime... press on "open in !MyTime"
    # !MyTime will ask you if you want to restore the file, press on "restore backup", and press "ok" on the prompt telling you to restart !MyTime
    # restart !MyTime, your data should be there and you should be running the old version of !MyTime

= If you have already Synced with iTunes =
If you have already synced with iTunes then you have two options:
  # Hopefully you have another device that syncs with the same iTunes account which has not upgraded MyTime
  # You have a backup software (Time Machine on a Mac) which has a backup of your iTunes application directory to restore from
  # You have another computer with a different iTunes account which has an older version of MyTime.

*You have another Device*
  # These are instructions for if you have another device that does not have the latest version of MyTime.  You MUST have an email backup or a backup of your mytime data file to proceed.
  # Make sure you have a valid email backup (maybe you need to follow the [iTunesBackup instructions here] to get your old data file)
  # Open iTunes on your computer, and delete MyTime from the applications 
  # sync your other iDevice that has the old MyTime
  # right click your iDevice in iTunes and select "Transfer Purchases"
  # now on your iPhone that you want to downgrade to an earlier version of MyTime, delete MyTime from the iPhone
  # now sync your iPhone with iTunes, this will put the older version of MyTime on your iPhone
  # you can now restore from your backup file to get your data back

*You have backup software*
  # Make sure you have a valid email backup (maybe you need to follow the [iTunesBackup instructions here] to get your old data file)
  # Open your backup software to the iTunes "Mobile Applications" folder, this might be in a couple of locations:
    # *OSX:* ~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications
    # *XP:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications
    # *Vista/Windows 7:* My Documents\My Music\iTunes\Mobile Applications
  # copy "!MyTime <version number>.ipa" to your desktop (where <version number> is something like 2.9.0)
  # now delete MyTime from your iTunes library on your computer
  # now drag the MyTime<version number>.ipa file that you saved on your desktop into the iTunes Library
  # Make sure you have a valid email backup and delete MyTime from your iPhone (maybe you need to follow the [iTunesBackup instructions here] to get your old data file)
  # sync your iPhone with iTunes which will copy the old version of MyTime to your iPhone
  # you can now restore from your backup file to get your data back


*Another computer with iTunes has an older version of MyTime*
We are going to use the "Home Sharing" feature of iTunes to copy over the old version of MyTime from the other computer to your computer.
  # Make sure you have a valid email backup (maybe you need to follow the [iTunesBackup instructions here] to get your old data file)
  # once you have a backup of your MyTime data file.  Delete MyTime from your iPhone and iTunes on your computer (DO NOT TOUCH MYTIME ON THE OTHER COMPUTER).
  # on your computer in iTunes, turn on "Home Sharing" by going to the "Advanced Menu" -> "Turn on Home Sharing", if it is already on then click on the "Home Sharing" label in the left side of iTunes.
  # You need to  use the same iTunes ID for home sharing as the other computer.  Make sure that you enable home sharing on your computer and the other computer with the same iTunes ID. 
  # once you have home sharing enabled on both computers and both computers are on the same network
    # On your computer in iTunes Check to see if in the "Home Sharing" label that you see the other computer showing up in the listi.  Click on the computer name of the other computer in iTunes
    # click on the triangle beside the computer name for the other computer and select the "Apps" folder
    # You should now see all of the applications that the other computer has in iTunes.
    # Select MyTime in that list and then click and drag it to your "LIBRARY" at the top left side of iTunes (your mouse should have a plus sign on it now).  This will copy the other computer's MyTime to your computer.
  # Make sure that MyTime is deleted on your iPhone and sync your iPhone with iTunes.
  # iTunes will now copy over the older version of MyTime to your iPhone.
  # Use the backup file that you retrieved at the start of these instructions to restore your data to the old version of MyTime
    # if you downgraded to MyTime 2.9.0 use "oldrecords.plist" or "backup.backupdata
    # if you downgraded to MyTime 3.1.0 and above use "MyTime.sqlite" or "backup.backupdb"
