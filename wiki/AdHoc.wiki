=MyTime Adhoc installation=
You should only have to worry about this page if you have signed up with me to be a translator or tester.

I occasionally email out one or two files for you to get updates of the MyTime application to test out.  The installation instructions are easy or involved depending on the number of files I send to you, so please pay attention, you will avoid much headache.

==When sent one file only==
When I send you one file, all you have to do is:
===On a Mac===
  # double click the MyTime.ipa file
  # sync your iphone


==When sent two files==
If you were sent two files, this is usually because someone else was added as a translator or tester and you will not be able to use the latest version of MyTime unless you update your version of the "MyTime AdHoc.mobileprovision" file as described below:

===If you have a version of MyTime installed from the AppStore===
Then you will not be able to install this version on top of this
  # you need to make sure that you are running the latest version of MyTime 
  # then do a manual backup in More->Settings->Email Backup and email the email to yourself (after verifying that the full contents of the email exist!).  
  # ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE BACKUP INSTRUCTIONS, you need to delete the MyTime application off of your iphone and itunes.

===On a Mac===
  # Close down iTunes, and Xcode (if you are running them)
  # delete the files in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/  on the Mac
  # plug in and sync your iphone/ipod
  # look in General->Profiles-> and Select any that say "MyTime AdHoc" and hit the "Remove" button
  # Disconnect your iphone from your Mac/PC
  # Quit iTunes
  # Drag the MyTime AdHoc.mobileprovision file that I sent this week into the iTunes dock icon
  # sync your iphone with your Mac
  # double click the MyTime.ipa file to install it into iTunes and agree to replace it
  # in iTunes press "Sync" on your iPhone to install it.

===On a PC===
  # look in General->Profiles-> and Select any that say "MyTime AdHoc" and hit the "Remove" button
  # Disconnect your iphone from your Mac/PC
  # Quit iTunes
  # Drag the MyTime AdHoc.mobileprovision file that I sent this week into the iTunes window into the LIBRARY text in the upper left hand corner of the iTunes application (you should see a + icon by your mouse)
  # sync your iphone with your PC
  # Finally drag the MyTime.ipa file into the iTunes window into the LIBRARY text in the upper left hand corner of the iTunes application (you should see a + icon by your mouse)
  # in iTunes press "Sync" on your iPhone to install it.

Please let me know if these instructions are not accurate/inadequate to get MyTime installed.  There have been a few people who have issues with this on Windows.
