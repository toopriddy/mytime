#summary Instructions to be able to convert not-at-homes into telephone territory

= Instructions =
The website(s) used to do reverse lookups have changed a lot, this causes prolbems when doing telephone territory infrequently, you will most likely notice that the website I am reccomending to you has changed as well, just let me know what one works if this is the case... just dont send me an "it does not work" email, please reccomend one which does.

  # go to http://www.whitepages.com/reverse-lookup
  # type in your not at home or the street of the territory you are trying to lookup
  # You might have to click on each individual search result to get at the telephone number.
  # DO NOT assume that the information presented is correct, make sure that you let people know that the information might be wrong.
  # you can use [http://mytime.googlecode.com/files/telephone%20territory.doc this document] as a template for telephone territory results (it has 2 columns to condense all of the information so that you do not waste paper).
