#summary Extract your MyTime data from your iTunes backups
= Extract your mytime data from your iTunes backups =

Here is some info about backups from apple's website http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1766

Here are some rules:
  # never ever setup your phone as a new phone, ALWAYS restore from a backup (even if the apple store told you to).
  # always keep up to date with your email backups.
  # sync your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch with iTunes regularly to keep a backup of your data.


== On OSX ==
These instructions only work if you have not encrypted your backup data

  # download http://supercrazyawesome.com/downloads/iPhone%20Backup%20Extractor.app.zip
  # extract and run the application 
  # Select the "Read Backups" button
  # Pick your device
  # Then select com.yourcompany.MyTime
  # press "Extract" and save this to your desktop.
  # your backup file should be in ~/Desktop/com.yourcompany.MyTime/Documents/MyTime.mytimedb
  # run the [http://mytime.googlecode.com/files/MyTime%20Backup-1.2.zip MyTime Backup] application and make sure that your iPhone is on the same wireless network as your Mac. (If you cant get this to work, email me your records.plist file)
  # on the iPhone, start MyTime and go to More->Settings->Backup using 'MyTime Backup'
  # on the Mac in the MyTime Backup program, select "Restore Backup" and then select the com.yourcompany.MyTime/Documents/records.plist file that was restored by the iPhone Backup Extractor application.
  # hit the home button on the iPhone to quit MyTime and restart MyTime to see your data

== On Windows ==
These instructions only work if you have not encrypted your backup data

*Please use iPhone Backup Extractor from http://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/ for now since iPhoneRescue is not compatible with the new iTunes backup format*
  # download http://priddysoftware.com/software/iPhoneRescue/iPhoneRescue%20Windows.zip from http://priddysoftware.com/software/iPhoneRescue/
  # extract and follow the instructions on http://priddysoftware.com/software/iPhoneRescue/ as to how to run the application
  # Select your devices name in the first column, pay attention to the backup date
  # then select "MyTime" from the middle list
  # then select the "records.plist" file in the third column (if you are using MyTime > 3.1.0 you are interested in getting the "MyTime.sqlite" file)
  # press "Save File" and save the file to your desktop
  # on the iPhone, start MyTime and go to More->Settings->Start MyTime Webserver
  # on your PC open a web browser following the onscreen instructions of MyTime
  # you should be viewing a webpage entitled "MyTime Webserver"
  # in the "Backup/Restore" section on the "Restore Backup File" line, press the "Browse" button and open that "records.plist" file that you saved on your desktop earlier.
  # now press the "Restore Backup" button
  # wait till you see the webpage refresh (should take 0-8 seconds)
  # hit the home button on the iPhone to quit MyTime and restart MyTime to see your data


== On Windows or OSX (alternative method) ==

  # You will need to navigate to one of the following directories:
    * On a Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/
    * On Windows XP: open "My Computer" and go to the "Tools" menu -> Folder Options -> View -> select "Show hidden files and folders" and hit OK.
      * From My Computer go to: c:\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
    * On Windows Vista: go to Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization > Folder Options > general > and make sure that "Show hidden files" is checked
      * from the Start->Computer go to C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
    * On Windows 7: go to Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization > Folder Options > general > and make sure that "Show hidden files" is checked
      * from the Start->Computer go to C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\
  # Now take a look at the directories that match the date/time stamp and zip up the ones that match (you might want to sort by the date/time by clicking on the "date" column).  Zip a directory by right-clicking the directory and go to -> Send To-> Compressed (Zipped) Folder
  # Now email me the zip file toopriddy@gmail.com and let me know what you are wanting and tell me the name of your iPhone/iPod
