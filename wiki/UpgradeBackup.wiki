First:
Install "OpenSSH" using the Installer Application, and reboot your iPhone/iTouch (Hold down the power button and slide to power off and then turn it back on).

Connect your iPhone/iTouch to your home WiFi network (or a friend's WiFi network) and figure out what your IP address is, on the iPhone:
  # Click on Settings -> Wi-Fi
  # Select ">" on the WiFi network your iPhone is on
  # remember the X.X.X.X "IP Address" on that page

Now get the file off of your iPhone by following these instructions:

Windows:
  # download [http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe PSCP] and save it in your c:\Windows directory
  # open up a command line terminal Start->Run and type in "cmd" and hit OK
  # Type in the following between the quotes (replace X.X.X.X with the IP address that you got above, and don't forget the period at the end)  
{{{pscp root@X.X.X.X:/var/mobile/Library/MyTime/record.plist .}}}
  # enter "alpine" as the password
_restoring a backup is as simple as reversing the period and the root@blah blah stuff, but please be careful, you don't want to overwrite your calls._

OSX:
  # open up a command line terminal "Applications/Utilities/Terminal"
  # Type in the following between the quotes (replace X.X.X.X with the IP address that you got above, and don't forget the period at the end) 
{{{scp root@X.X.X.X:/var/mobile/Library/MyTime/record.plist .}}}
  # enter "alpine" as the password
