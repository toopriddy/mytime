#requests for help from a Graphics Artist, because I am not one.

I am a programmer, and have limited knowledge about graphic art programs.  I have done a "beta" job of producing images for the MyTime™ Program.  I received many pictures for the icon for MyTime™ and am very appreciative of the person that created it.

My concern is more along the lines about the buttons at the bottom of the MyTime™ view. (if you go to More->Edit you can see all of them, or just look at the picture below).  I do not want to add any snazzy/useless images or transitions, I want to make this program useful and minimize things that "just get in the way".

I am trying to stay with the "apple theme" of blue/gray buttons like what is used in the phone application on the iphone and the ipod application on the iphone. I want something that makes it obvious what the tab is that you are looking at.

The button bar pictures that are due for changing are:

  * **Mapped calls:** this looks like spaghetti but it is supposed to be the highways around Huntsville, AL

I have other tabs that I want to come up with and it is always a choir to create the little icon for that tab.

What I might want to do is come up with an email list of people who could do some pictures for me and just email out for someone to offer help when available.

you can get at all of the pictures (and the code for that matter) at http://code.google.com/p/mytime/source/browse/#svn/trunk they are all .png files.  Here is a quote straight from apple's documentation:


Before you create the art for your icon, you need to spend some time thinking about what it should convey. As you consider designs, aim for an icon that is:

  * Simple and streamlined. Too many details can make an icon appear sloppy or indecipherable.
  * Not easily mistaken for one of the system-provided icons. Users should be able to distinguish your custom icon from the standard icons at a glance.
  * Readily understood and widely acceptable. Strive to create a symbol that most users will interpret correctly and that no users will find offensive.

After you've decided on the appearance of your icon, follow these guidelines as you create it:
  * Use the PNG format.
  * Use white with appropriate alpha and no shadow.
  * Use anti-aliasing.
  * For tab bar icons, create an icon that measures about 30 x 30 pixels.

The images displayed on the tab bar are derived from this image. If this image is too large to fit on the tab bar, it is scaled to fit. The size of an tab bar image is typically 30 x 30 points. The alpha values in the source image are used to create the unselected and selected images—opaque values are ignored.
